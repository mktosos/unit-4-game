Crystal Collector

This is a game that utilizes random number generators, onClick events, and if else comparisons.

Each jewel is assigned a random number between 1-12. The user gets to know its hidden value by pressing it and obsering the results. The object is to accumulate the jewels, matching the random number the game gives you. An exact match is a win. If you go over, you lose. The game resarts after a win or loss and tallies your results.
